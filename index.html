            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>This website is a passion project born from the lived experience of Niniwe Xaka, a 36-year-old plus-size woman who understands the challenges and triumphs of navigating a world that often overlooks the beauty and strength of larger bodies. Niniwe, like many plus-size women, has faced bullying and societal pressures throughout her life. But instead of letting these experiences define her, she chose to embark on a journey of self-love and acceptance.
                <strong>"We're not here for long," Niniwe believes,</strong> and we shouldn't spend most of our time hating ourselves. We should strive for a good quality of life and be able to do things we love with our loved ones."</p>

            <h3>Why Plus-Size Wellness Matters</h3>
            <p>For too long, the wellness industry has focused on a narrow definition of health, often excluding and shaming plus-size individuals. This website exists to challenge that narrative and create a space where plus-size women can prioritize their well-being without judgment. Majority of plus-size women are depressed because of weight. This highlights the crucial role that mental and emotional well-being plays in overall wellness.</p>

            <h4>Plus-size wellness is about:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Reclaiming Our Narratives: It's about taking control of our stories and defining our own paths to health and happiness.</li>
                <li>Building Community: It's about creating a supportive network where we can share our experiences, find encouragement, and celebrate our successes.</li>
                <li>Prioritizing Mental Health: It's about addressing the emotional toll of weight stigma and fostering self-compassion.</li>
                <li>Promoting Sustainable Health: It's about making lifestyle choices that are enjoyable and maintainable in the long term, not about quick fixes or restrictive diets.</li>
                <li>Living Fully: It's about having the energy and vitality to pursue our passions and enjoy life to the fullest.</li>
            </ul>
